While folks on PC have largely managed to escape performance issues, users on every other platform for which the RPG is currently available have reported frequent occurrences of clearly unintended behavior. In extreme cases, these have led to outright crashes or, even worse, game-breaking flaws completely preventing progress through main story missions.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>While CDPR has since issued a statement publicly apologizing for the current situation, many have been left wondering how its adaptation of the beloved tabletop adventure even managed to pass Microsoft and Sony’s certification process. Comments provided by upper management in a recent conference call <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have since shed further light</a> on that apparent loophole, but the story doesn’t end there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Open_Critic-1338502656931860481-20201214_151436-img1.jpg><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>In an article published on OpenCritic earlier this week, site co-founder Matthew Enthoven accuses the studio of deliberately misleading consumers over the state of Cyberpunk‘s console versions by only distributing PC copies to the press for review.</p><p data-characters=569 data-current-count=823 data-injectable=true>This, he says, was a calculated decision to ensure that bonuses reliant on high critic scores were appropriately awarded. A report by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier has since revealed that not to be the case, of course, with payouts said to remain static regardless of the game’s performance. Does that revelation make Enthoven’s claims any less likely, then? Not at all, but the underhanded actions he accuses CDPR of undertaking almost certainly wouldn’t have been a choice for members of the development team to make but rather, upper management.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>Regardless of rhyme or reason, though, the outcome remains unchanged. <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong> is in desperate need of some TLC on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and we’ll just have to wait and see if a series of upcoming patches truly can remedy the current mess.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZopqmdnpi%2FqsDInGScpJGeurR5wrKZnqqgqruseZFpbnBllJrDbrzUq6eoq5Wbwq242Gajop2UYrSiucSsZKmqn5e5prnSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-pronounce-gethsemane.html><span>←</span><span>How to pronounce gethsemane</span></a>
