After the pair split in September 2019, Carter <a href=#>penned an essay for Elle in November</a>, which she said helped her get through the breakup.</p><p>“I’m not at all embarrassed by the Elle piece,” the reality star said on the Monday, December 21, episode of the “<a href=#>Scrubbing In</a>” podcast.</p><p>The model explained that “no one was more surprised that <a href=#>I was all of a sudden dating one of my girlfriends</a> than I was,” which is part of the reason she said she wrote the piece.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kaitlynn-Miley-Brody.jpg><p>“When I look back, I know that I had feelings for her that were maybe different from feelings I had for other friends,” Carter revealed. “It was entirely unintentional, but I was very deeply in love with this person.”</p><p>The “Bright Side” podcast host noted that she finally understood the saying that heartbreak inspires creativity after she broke up with the<a href=#> “Midnight Sky” singer</a>.</p><p>“All of a sudden all I wanted to do was create things,” she said. “That Elle piece was one of those things that were super cathartic.”</p><p>Carter’s whirlwind romance with Cyrus came after she split from Jenner, 37, in August 2019 <a href=#>a year after they wed in a ceremony in Bali</a> (the pair never legalized their union).</p><p>Despite being “really excited” to <a href=#>work with Jenner on the Hills reboot</a>, Carter noted that filming the MTV show highlighted their relationship flaws ahead of their split.</p><p>“It was hard filming the first season because — there were so many difficult things going in our lives that everything stressed us out,” she revealed. “We didn’t want to share all these heavy things with the world [but] they get everything out of you. No secret is safe.”</p><p>The <a href=#>New Hampshire native</a> noted that the show’s first season aired three weeks before she and Jenner broke up. The separation, however, has not ruined their bond.</p><p>“I think the reason he and I ended up getting married in the first place was because we were always such good friends,” she explained. “And that is something we’ve been able to salvage through our split.”</p><p>Carter has since moved on and has been dating the Brock Collection founder since May.</p><p>“I don’t want to have a relationship that’s in the tabloids. I don’t want to do overly public things,” she said, before opening up about her new flame.</p><p>According to Carter, her dynamic with the Texas native is “going very well” and has no drama.</p><p>“It’s the most seamless, chill relationship,” she said. “I’ve never had a relationship that was just easy. I feel like he’s the first adult that I’ve ever dated.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>TV personality</a> called her boyfriend the “gayest straight man” she knows, noting the pair have a “lot of feminine things in common.”</p><p>She added: “He’s a dream.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZmpubq6zWaamqqkmr9uvsSfo56bpKh6sLqMpqClnalisLq%2B1Kxkm6qfmcZutsSnpZ6qXae8rq3NnJysZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-packer-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>James Packer Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
