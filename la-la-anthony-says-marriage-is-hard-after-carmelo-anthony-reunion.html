Months after reconciling with husband <a href=#><strong>Carmelo Anthony</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>La La Anthony</strong></a> opened up to Us Weekly about the challenges of matrimony.</p><p>“You know, marriage is hard,” the 39-year-old exclusively told Us at the taping of VH1 Dear Mama: A Love Letter to Mom at Los Angeles’ Ace Hotel on Thursday, May 2. “I tell everybody that, and it’s one day at a time, and that’s what we’re doing. Just trying to take it one day at a time.”</p><p>La La and Carmelo have been married since July 2010 but <a href=#>split in April 2017</a>. The couple stepped out together on multiple occasions in fall 2018, though, and sources confirmed to Us in December that they were <a href=#>giving their relationship another shot</a>.</p><p>“La La and Carmelo have recently reconciled and they truly still love one another,” an insider close to La La said at the time. “It’s so obvious when they’re together.”</p><p>The insider also revealed that the couple’s 12-year-old son, Kiyan, was a factor in their decision to get back together. “They also both want what’s best for their son and are committed to being a family,” the insider said.</p><p>That same month, La La sparked pregnancy rumors, but another source close to the former MTV veejay told Us at the time that she and Carmelo are <a href=#>not expecting a second child</a>. And at Thursday’s event, La La told Us there are “probably” no more kids in their future.</p><p>In keeping with the theme of Thursday’s event, the Star actress revealed her Mother’s Day plans to Us. “[Staying] home, watching TV, having breakfast in bed is always exciting because you are constantly on the go, so to just shut down for a day is always a treat.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[Kiyan] is my best friend,” she added. “He’s there for me through everything. I learn from him. We learn from each other. And I’m just honored to be his mom. He’s 12 years old. He’s turning into a great student, great athlete, great person, and that means a lot to me.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Rath</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmV2hrm6tza2fqKapYsCixdJmpJqqop6uqLGMoqpmoJGnsW6txa2cq2WTlr%2BuscuoZJqmpJ28r8WMq5yuppmku3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-ripa-silk-pillowcase.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Ripa-Loved Silk Pillowcases for Hair &amp;amp; Skin Is 2 for $5 on Amazon</span></a>
