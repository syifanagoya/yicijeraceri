The Boy is the latest movie to be added into the list. As the name suggests the movie revolves around a boy only a little unnatural boy in many ways. Set in a village distanced from the city, a young girl takes on a job of a nanny only to find that the boy she has come to take care of is different from what she anticipated him to be. However, this young fellow has his own rules and regulations, which if not obeyed can lead to disastrous consequences. Being independent and bold as the girl was, she choose to seemingly ignore some of these rules which lands her into trouble with the boy.</p><p>Here is a trailer that has been officially released where one can see the difference between other boys and The Boy who is the main subject of this movie.<br>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1U21VBSbSs]</p><p>The Boy would be directed by well known horror film maker William Brent Bell who has earlier directed horror flicks like Stay Alive, The Devil Inside and Wer. The movie was earlier titled as the Inhabitant but was later changed to The Boy. The movie features Lauren Cohan in the lead role of the nanny. She has been previously seen in horror shows like Supernatural, The Walking Dead and The Vampire Diaries. &nbsp;Rupert Evans of The Canal fame would be playing an important character in the movie. Jim Norton who is featured in a variety of roles in various television series would be seen in a major role in The Boy. Diana Hardcastle previously seen in movies like The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, A Good Woman, Good People and If Only plays the role of The Boy’s mother.</p><p>With an interesting plot and an excellent ensemble cast, one can only wait and see how the movie fares amongst its audience next year. The Boy is scheduled to release on the 22nd of January 2016.</p><p>Do let us know if you are excited for the movie at @CelebMix !</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kr7DFjKyrqKqpYsKvwdKumKVlkqTGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ray-romano-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html><span>←</span><span>Ray Romano | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</span></a>
