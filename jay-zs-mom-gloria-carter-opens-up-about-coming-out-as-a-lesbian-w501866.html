I was sitting there and I was telling him one day, I just finally started telling him who I was,” she explained on the <i>D’USSE Friday</i> podcast on Tuesday, September 5. “Besides your mother, this is the person that I am. This is the life that I live. My son started actually tearing ’cause he’s like, ‘That had to be a horrible life, Ma.’ I was like, ‘My life was never horrible. It was just different.’ So that made him want to do a song about it.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>The track almost didn’t see the light of day, though. “The first time I heard the song, I was like, ‘Eh, I don’t know, dude. I ain’t feeling that,'” Gloria recalled. “When it first happened, I was sharing myself [with Jay], not to share myself with the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After several discussions with her son, Gloria’s apprehension faded away and she agreed to appear on the song. “I was never ashamed of me. But in my family, it was something that was never discussed,” she said. “I’m tired of all the mystery. I’m gonna give it to ’em. … Now it’s time for me to live my life and be happy, be free.”</p><p>For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, <a href=#>subscribe to</a> Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmalix7R5zKikZp%2BcpL%2BqrYycmKuslad6sLzEp6pmraBirqO71K1knKednruoec6uq2aZo2KubrjErJmimZ5ixHZ8kHFtb2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teen-mom-2-recap-leah-messer-served-divorce-papers-suicidal-thoughts-2015208.html><span>←</span><span>Teen Mom 2 Recap: Leah Is Served Divorce Papers, Has Suicidal Thoughts</span></a>
