The truth is that I love my baby to bits, but the rest of it sucked. Pregnancy was the biggest killer for me. I hated it - I hated being fat.</p><p>"My hormones were all over the place and I acted like some lunatic, picking fights with my boyfriend over how he made my coffee.</p><p>"On top of that I had this hideous 'pregnancy mask' skin discolouration which completely covered my face.</p><p>"You can normally use creams to disguise it, but not when you're pregnant, so I had to walk around looking like I was horribly disfigured. This may sound arrogant, but I'm used to looking hot I just wanted to cry all the time."</p><p>The star is now enjoying being a mother to son Dezi but she is no hurry to get pregnant again.</p><p>She said: "Nobody tells you this stuff when you talk about having a baby - it's all kept as one big secret. The only amazing thing is when your baby pops out and you have this little thing that is going to be part of your life forever."</p><p>Pressly also said she wants to be a "sexy mum".</p><p>Pressly gave birth two months ago and is working hard to get her incredible figure back in time for her 30th birthday part in Las Vegas on July 30.</p><p>Jaime said: "I'm having a party and then a holiday and I aim to be in a super-slutty outfit for the first and a swimsuit for the second.</p><p>"I love being a mother, but I want to be a super sexy mother with a better body than ever before.</p><p>"When I pull on my spray-on jeans for my party, I want to look in the mirror and like what I see."</p><p>The blonde actress is working out for two hours a day and following a low-fat protein diet.</p><p>She said: "people may think it's mad but it makes me happier to see my body coming back."</p><p>Even though Pressly admits she hated pregnancy she has slammed celebrities who adopt.</p><p>Jamie said: "Some women just skip having babies or adopt because they don't want to get fat or they haven't put in the time to find a partner. It's great to adopt, but a lot of adoptions are motivated by vanity and laziness."</p><p>The blonde actress also claimed some actresses miss out on motherhood because they focus too much on their careers.</p><p>She said: "So many Hollywood actresses become successful and then just keep on going - they miss out on having a partner and a baby and end up lonely.</p><p>"I know a lot of very rich, very successful, very lonely women in Los Angeles and I never wanted to be one of them."</p><p>- BANG!
