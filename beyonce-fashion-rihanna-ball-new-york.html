The forest-hued design featured a plunging neckline and &nbsp;daring thigh-high split, and was accessorised with black leg-lengthening heels and diamond bangles. <a class=hm-link href=#>Jay-Z</a>, meanwhile, looked dapper in a navy suit, crisp white shirt and black bow tie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/48ea0b349ec7-beyonce3-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eFdXbU9d38qe data-wc=7><strong>Beyoncé and Jay-Z at Rihanna's Diamond Ball</strong></p><p id=e44rrSZyYx0e data-wc=57>Beyoncé, who wore her honey-hued hair styled in loose curls, was practically glowing throughout the evening. Her radiant complexion was enhanced with a sweep of bronzer across the apples of her cheeks, and her eyes stood out with a bold outline of black liner and lashings of mascara. A strong brow and pink lipgloss completed her look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1083012f8963-beyoncerihanna-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eeRbWFt9Au4r data-wc=7><strong>Rihanna looked sensational in a black ballgown</strong></p><p id=eYX77meo8YJd data-wc=50>It's been a busy few weeks for Beyoncé, who celebrated her 36th birthday earlier in the month. The Lemonade singer spent her day at Jay-Z's Made in America festival in Philadelphia, and recruited local bakery Cake Life Bake Shop to create a special cake, thought to have cost around £2,600. &nbsp;</p><p id=egfOWNXMJsHt data-wc=65>Known for her extravagant fashion, Beyoncé caused a social media frenzy back in July after she introduced the world to her twins. And while the attention was on her babies, her show-stopping gown also got people talking. The striking floor-length number by Spanish designer Palomo Spain was adorned in a whimsical floral print in mauve hues, and was part of the fashion houses' SS17 collection. &nbsp;</p><p id=eLF5XgIAbk7i data-wc=93>All throughout her pregnancy, Beyoncé,&nbsp;who is also mum to Blue Ivy, five,&nbsp;wowed fans with some seriously stylish outfits,&nbsp;spanning form-fitting dresses at red carpet events to cool jeans and bang-on-trend slogan tees while spending time relaxing at home. Memorable outfits included her&nbsp;head-turning gold embellished Peter Dundas gown that she wore to debut her baby bump on stage at the Grammys back in February, and her statement slogan 'preggers' T-shirt, which she teamed with ripped jeans, a denim jacket and white trainers while posing in her garden in an Instagram photo.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
