David's interest in an acting career came while he was still in high school. O'Hara left Scotland to pursue the craft at the age of 17, studying at London's Central School of Speech and Drama. He made his film debut in a small part in Bill Forsyth's Comfort and Joy (1984) and played a Scottish boy in The Monocled Mutineer (BBC 1986), his first effort on the small screen.</p><p>Among David's stage performances, he portrayed Tybalt in a 1986 open-air production of Romeo and Juliet and three years later took on the play's more challenging role of Mercutio. His big break came as Stephen, the rampaging Irishman who joins forces with William Wallace (Mel Gibson), in Braveheart (1995). Two years later, he co-starred opposite Helen Mirren as a slightly independent policeman in Granada Television's Prime Suspect V: Errors in Judgment, which aired on PBS' Masterpiece Theatre. That same year (1997), David appeared in Alan J. Pakula's The Devil's Own as the romantic foil to Janeane Garofalo in The Matchmaker, as a biker in the Scottish film The Slab Boys and as Bill Sykes in The Wonderful World of Disney adaptation of Oliver Twist (ABC). In 2006, O'Hara appeared as Fitzy in the Oscar winning film The Departed. In June 2009, he worked on The Tudors in Dublin. He played Albert Runcorn and Harry Potter disguised as Runcorn in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows‚ÄîPart 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeUlsOqsIyoZKGZopZ6r7HTZq6oqqSdenODl2ttag%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fess-parker-net-worth-at-death.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Fess Parker Net Worth At Death</span></a>
