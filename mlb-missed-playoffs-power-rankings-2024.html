Much will change between now and next spring, but here’s where these clubs stand and how quickly I think they can turn things around.</p><p>The Padres were the best team in baseball that didn’t make the postseason. They finished second in the National League in team ERA and sixth in runs scored. They had the front-runner for the Cy Young Award (<a class=ath_autolink data-id=eJrKuW4uanxU3oFm href=#>Blake Snell</a>) and the front-runner for the Trevor Hoffman Award (<a class=ath_autolink data-id=PZDdlmz3HtANJRaV href=#>Josh Hader</a>). <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NxTzrhe2HdUzjr6T href=#>Juan Soto</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=hlO4E371SbPAEH8e href=#>Manny Machado</a> both hit 30 or more home runs, while <a class=ath_autolink data-id=QVAGr3yKMbDApdzv href=#>Fernando Tatis Jr.</a> blasted 25 and stole 29 bases. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=L6CBHty9Z293VU3c href=#>Ha-Seong Kim</a> had his best season, hitting 17 homers and stealing 38 bags. The Padres will likely have to do significant cost-cutting this offseason, which would make it difficult to retain several of their free agents, including Hader and Snell. However, they still should be considered a bounce-back candidate for 2024.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The Reds had <a href=# rel=noopener>the best rookie class</a> of any team this season and have set themselves up to be perennial contenders for the foreseeable future. Their decision at the trade deadline to stand pat and not add veteran starting pitching might have cost them a playoff berth. Still, it positioned them nicely for 2024, as their young rotation, led by Hunter Greene, Andrew Abbott, Brandon Williamson and Connor Phillips, received invaluable experience in the pennant race. The Reds are expected this winter to cut ties with <a href=# rel=noopener>future Hall of Famer Joey Votto</a>, who has a team option for 2024, and will be shopping second baseman Jonathan India for either starting pitching or an outfield upgrade. They have built a strong nucleus of young players, including <a class=ath_autolink data-id=noPgJ59LWDK7uvVn href=#>Elly De La Cruz</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=S9ovJoEVSIM7q0ut href=#>Matt McLain</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=azW1KyZJ6h3KvqsE href=#>Noelvi Marte</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=OSiset338cZuFsPQ href=#>Will Benson</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ppYG7FPfZvKa5uu4 href=#>Spencer Steer</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=3ZUPMhQZk9AjInsq href=#>Christian Encarnacion-Strand</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=oGJOB5kwcwpPhs1l href=#>TJ Friedl</a>, and I’m already picking them to win the NL Central in 2024.</p><p>The Mariners just missed the playoffs this season but have built a pitching staff that should keep them in contention for years to come. They have the rotation, led by veteran <a class=ath_autolink data-id=5ch8W8Dgo9RY8yQl href=#>Luis Castillo</a> and youngsters <a class=ath_autolink data-id=KGtaPmvCXnLWXBvi href=#>Logan Gilbert</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>George Kirby</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0mejbtUiwcWXzO14 href=#>Bryce Miller</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ldDEf8MDIjHX5VvN href=#>Bryan Woo</a>, along with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=hHvFog0oNkjbmokN href=#>Robbie Ray</a>, the 2021 American League Cy Young winner, who should return from Tommy John surgery by the second half of next season. In order to make the postseason next year, the Mariners need to build up the lineup around <a class=ath_autolink data-id=srSnhiOiHfohqBN2 href=#>Julio Rodríguez</a>. They need more contact, fewer strikeouts and more impact along with better lineup depth; address those needs and they could make a run at the World Series in 2024.</p><p>The Mets took an important step for their organization’s future in hiring David Stearns as president of baseball operations. Stearns is one of the most respected executives in the game. He’ll build the organization the right way, from scouting to analytics to player development, and it will be interesting to see what he does with a large payroll, something he’s never had at his disposal in his career. That said, <a href=# rel=noopener>this offseason is off to an unusual start,</a> as the Mets have fired manager Buck Showalter, introduced Stearns, accepted the resignation of general manager Billy Eppler, and <a href=#>come under investigation by MLB</a> for improper use of the injured list. Stearns will need to navigate these waters as he revamps the club, but he will have the benefit of loads of good young players in the majors and minors to use as building blocks. He’ll need to try to sign first baseman <a class=ath_autolink data-id=z5TM8FHqigQaQRib href=#>Pete Alonso</a>, a free agent after the 2024 season, to a long-term contract or consider trading him this offseason while his value is high. Although the Mets are probably a year or two away from World Series contention, I’ll be surprised if they don’t make a run at several top free agents, including <a class=ath_autolink data-id=PYXhWEdNdM6bQVDP href=#>Shohei Ohtani</a> and Yoshinobu Yamamoto.</p><p>The Yankees somehow finished with a winning record (82-80) for the 31st consecutive season despite the fact that their rotation beyond ace <a href=# rel=noopener>Gerrit Cole, the expected AL Cy Young winner</a>, completely fell apart. Carlos Rodón started the season on the IL, then never pitched up to his accustomed level after signing a $162 million contract last winter. Frankie Montas was sidelined with a shoulder injury for essentially the entire season, <a href=# rel=noopener>Domingo Germán was placed on the restricted list,</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>Nestor Cortes dealt with rotator cuff issues</a>, and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1LMxEGTMGVAzb2Rr href=#>Luis Severino</a> dealt with an oblique injury and a lack of command when he was on the mound, leaving <a class=ath_autolink data-id=lekDWuNrcHh12XZb href=#>Clarke Schmidt</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=LvLKgTReZ9gXVg3C href=#>Michael King</a> as the team’s next best starters. On the position player side, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=SFIT5wwDvRYLsber href=#>Aaron Judge</a> delivered when he wasn’t on the IL, but injuries and underperformance were the story for most of the Yankees’ veterans, from <a class=ath_autolink data-id=hAE9rcYHkn8K3All href=#>Anthony Rizzo</a> to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=rRhozcGWpuYcCdd4 href=#>Giancarlo Stanton</a> to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=GDdPp7I0BpRBtt0J href=#>DJ LeMahieu</a>. The Yankees got younger in the final month of the season, which provided a spark on the field and in the clubhouse; <a class=ath_autolink data-id=CJysrgijolFehzIs href=#>Jasson Domínguez</a> was the best of the group until he suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament that required Tommy John surgery. This club has a lot of work to do this offseason to build back its rotation, get younger and more athletic, and add more on-base percentage, contact and depth to the lineup.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The Red Sox <a href=# rel=noopener>fired chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom</a> last month and are focused on their search to replace him as they promise that the new head of baseball operations will have full autonomy. Despite not making the playoffs, a lot of positive signs emerged this season as many of Boston’s young players, from first baseman <a class=ath_autolink data-id=gMMtdVyiYDkspCZK href=#>Triston Casas</a> to outfielders <a class=ath_autolink data-id=LIgtaBrx7W7eczqj href=#>Jarren Duran</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Ulj4PknqjSrYfaka href=#>Ceddanne Rafaela</a> to young starter <a class=ath_autolink data-id=j2gIMX08YciVOzLw href=#>Brayan Bello</a>, showed their potential in the majors. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Rr3WX4art5uDfwcr href=#>Trevor Story</a> successfully returned from Tommy John surgery and free agents <a class=ath_autolink data-id=a5LqurG3A1U5h6BL href=#>Masataka Yoshida</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2O3UNBGeKYQnexTR href=#>Justin Turner</a> lived up to their contracts. The Red Sox also found their catcher for the future, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=DKctUY7J1nr8VeFN href=#>Connor Wong</a>, and their bullpen was much improved. Now they need to make a splash this offseason — whether that’s a trade for Juan Soto or a statement signing like Shohei Ohtani or <a class=ath_autolink data-id=C79P7luR8MM8ZftM href=#>Cody Bellinger</a> and landing a top free-agent starter such as Blake Snell, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=lR06mWlShqL9tUcb href=#>Aaron Nola</a> or Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Boston’s ownership must get back to “checkbook baseball” now that the Red Sox have established a strong young core.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/10/03165514/GettyImages-1702859450-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Cody Bellinger is just one of several free-agency decisions the Cubs will need to make this offseason. (Jamie Sabau / Getty Images)</span><p>The Cubs were in the pennant race until the final weekend of the regular season, thanks to the front-runner for NL Comeback Player of the Year, Cody Bellinger, team leader <a class=ath_autolink data-id=5zqMPlNdHIw4Q3i7 href=#>Dansby Swanson</a> and Cy Young candidate <a class=ath_autolink data-id=DPtNzwLTsNYgkOqn href=#>Justin Steele</a>. Manager David Ross did an excellent job of navigating the bullpen, and right fielder <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2K0ed4mlUN93bC3A href=#>Seiya Suzuki</a> lived up to his $85 million contract with a strong second half. The Cubs will have difficult free-agent decisions to make as Bellinger, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=HD85zMDdl431ujN3 href=#>Marcus Stroman</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ywpxRKneFoBnVKVF href=#>Jeimer Candelario</a> are all expected to hit the market. They have a strong defensive team and are well-positioned to contend again in 2024, but must be prepared to spend this offseason.</p><p>The Giants loaded their roster with average or slightly-above-average major-league players from top to bottom and played like it over the course of the 162-game season, hovering around .500 for most of the year. They operated more like a small-market team, mixing and matching their pitching staff and lineup on most nights to try to win that way. What the Giants need to return to October baseball are some stars — for the middle of their lineup and their rotation. They <a href=# rel=noopener>fired manager Gabe Kapler</a> and it will be interesting to see what type of management style they go with in the new hire. They are expected to be players in free agency this offseason and have plenty of money to spend.</p><p>The Guardians had a disappointing season and will head into 2024 with a new leader after <a href=# rel=noopener>the retirement of longtime manager Terry Francona</a>, but all is not lost. They’ve established an incredible starting pitching room, augmenting a staff that was led by <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Wi7JTCgSc6VurTU7 href=#>Shane Bieber</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=b0VCOVu7YFyKtGst href=#>Triston McKenzie</a> with the arrivals of rookies <a class=ath_autolink data-id=CU0YsxAVegmrz06B href=#>Tanner Bibee</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=CXWSOnTcDm2uOiGI href=#>Gavin Williams</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Cjmvan8LmKFHBqgR href=#>Logan Allen</a>, who established themselves as middle-of-the-rotation starters if not more. However, the Guardians have a lot of work to do to improve their offense around <a class=ath_autolink data-id=zW1kUusmRLJMuY49 href=#>José Ramírez</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=q5XaZe8fRQawb1aj href=#>Josh Naylor</a>. They are expected to shop Bieber this offseason and could look to land a young controllable impact bat in return. Bottom line: If they want to contend in 2024, the offense will need to look a lot different than it did this year.</p><p>The Cardinals were the most disappointing team this season thanks to a rotation that completely fell apart and a bunch of outfielders who were injured or underperformed. They missed catcher Yadier Molina more than they expected and didn’t get the offensive production they hoped for from a lot of their young players. The Cardinals will spend this offseason rebuilding their rotation and need to make at least two or three upgrades if they want any chance of turning things around in 2024. The good news is they still have the best corner infield in the game with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=cIMcObLXGUH9ajDk href=#>Paul Goldschmidt</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NwWX30LugDqHE7Oq href=#>Nolan Arenado</a>, along with three top young players in outfielders <a class=ath_autolink data-id=cKVBW6ZMf1lSgH86 href=#>Jordan Walker</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=34FhbNekNaWKnbCL href=#>Lars Nootbaar</a> and shortstop <a class=ath_autolink data-id=uf01RfxTZNlTtUD3 href=#>Masyn Winn</a>. With a strong offseason, the Cardinals have the infrastructure to get right back into the NL Central race next year.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Detroit’s offseason started with president of baseball operations Scott Harris <a href=# rel=noopener>hiring Jeff Greenberg as GM</a>. This past season, the Tigers began to make progress at the major-league level, as outfielder <a class=ath_autolink data-id=GNPMmQ5sAievAaDf href=#>Riley Greene</a> and first baseman <a class=ath_autolink data-id=khRIyDpIZSisPiFx href=#>Spencer Torkelson</a> started to live up to expectations. Rookie center fielder <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MzG5TqPz9Q4vlqbQ href=#>Parker Meadows</a> and right fielder <a class=ath_autolink data-id=KkJ2RUfOE2Zp52O3 href=#>Kerry Carpenter</a> established themselves as key contributors. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ik7lfPxjt9H0whkL href=#>Tarik Skubal</a> successfully returned from flexor tendon surgery and by the end of the year proved he was a No. 1 starter the club could build around. The key for the Tigers in 2024 will be the development and health of their young starting pitchers and adding more thump to the middle of their lineup. Under the leadership of Harris and manager A.J. Hinch, they’re headed in the right direction.</p><p>The Pirates have quietly positioned themselves to be a surprise team in 2024. They have built a strong young core of talent with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=JplEvotTfTARkXlk href=#>Bryan Reynolds</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=fxA7ZeaGTvPh6k7R href=#>Ke’Bryan Hayes</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=LJRbxhgS4pdL9goT href=#>Jack Suwinski</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=tJZ7UxZYAAuaw7Y5 href=#>Henry Davis</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=a4mdYLL1p04zwvLa href=#>Endy Rodríguez</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2u1KtAMRxOYHDsIT href=#>Nick Gonzales</a>, and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=bHf6oZBIUWgEuWiW href=#>Oneil Cruz</a>, who next year will be coming back from ankle surgery. Those players are all capable of having breakout seasons or making real strides next year. The question of whether the Pirates are ready to contend will come down to their rotation, which includes <a class=ath_autolink data-id=nWUc6Go98Y5J5woo href=#>Mitch Keller</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=nRHdjkCuHsMFaL1F href=#>Quinn Priester</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=lq34mPwz8dFp0EZA href=#>Johan Oviedo</a>.</p><p>The Nationals are taking their time to rebuild the right way, realizing it can take five to seven years to become a World Series contender. This was their fourth straight season winning fewer than 72 games, and they should be ready to at least approach .500 next year. The Nationals’ strong farm system features prospects <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MSlatiagUQ32orEk href=#>Dylan Crews</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=j2hvHhbNxd9EaIMv href=#>James Wood</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=aoc4Mrm2pOIXvBXt href=#>Brady House</a>, all of whom should make it to Washington in the second half of 2024, which would set the team up to be legitimate contenders by 2025.</p><p>The Angels started their offseason by firing manager Phil Nevin and soon likely will be saying goodbye to Shohei Ohtani, although they will make a strong push to re-sign him when he hits the open market. <a href=# rel=noopener>Ohtani is expected to prioritize winning in free agency</a> and the Angels will have a tough time making the case they’re the best destination after six years of playing under .500 with him. The Angels do have some positives they can take from 2024, including the flashes of excellence from rookies <a class=ath_autolink data-id=M8w0yJeBRIlAUhRf href=#>Nolan Schanuel</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=5qYOw8OutnHDZGt2 href=#>Zach Neto</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=h4CnWkM0kSjgCJ49 href=#>Logan O’Hoppe</a>. They still have one of the game’s best players, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=KJGSXFXlt4bQ7ryA href=#>Mike Trout</a>, if they can ever keep him healthy. However, this is a team loaded with below-average major leaguers and a farm system that ranks as one of the worst in baseball. The Angels don’t have much to trade and still have a lot of bad money on their books, including <a class=ath_autolink data-id=HnQV7Grg1QiyO8LO href=#>Anthony Rendon</a>’s contract, which has three years and more than $115 million remaining.</p><p>The White Sox fired their top baseball executives, EVP Ken Williams and GM Rick Hahn, and replaced them with incoming GM Chris Getz. He is expected to be aggressive this offseason in rebuilding the major-league team and has already told his peers in other front offices that there are no untouchables on the roster, although it’s unlikely he’d consider moving center fielder <a class=ath_autolink data-id=pPo62FcaJJSyZ9wT href=#>Luis Robert Jr.</a> The White Sox are hoping to get more out of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=cX3PXo1UYMBlMxYq href=#>Eloy Jiménez</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=GZMmP6biFf1lzf5B href=#>Yoán Moncada</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=3QPHBfslnS5UgTTA href=#>Andrew Vaughn</a> next year and want to focus on improving the team’s defense and clubhouse culture. They also must significantly improve the rotation before they can contend again.</p><p>The Rockies finished in last place again this season but had some positive signs, including the contributions of rookies <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ynAZsMgGZyWurBWA href=#>Nolan Jones</a> (4.3 bWAR) and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=SRRJqwxBFOUaq3XR href=#>Ezequiel Tovar</a> (2.5 WAR). Jones looks to be a mainstay in the middle of their lineup, while Tovar is an elite defender who showed he’s their long-term answer at shortstop. It’s always been a challenge for the Rockies to develop a pitching staff good enough to win at Coors Field, but no one should complain about their efforts in the draft and in trades.</p><p>The Royals have one of the best young players in baseball, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=n9gFygLmR7kvJwNe href=#>Bobby Witt Jr.</a>, who I think will hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in 2024. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=qDzwBA7ygWyTtwoJ href=#>Salvador Perez</a> is still their team leader, while <a class=ath_autolink data-id=KW2Amy8IB6Dpifjd href=#>MJ Melendez</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MUPFa90o5FHBybIB href=#>Maikel Garcia</a> are starting to establish themselves as solid everyday players. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=YlaU1umYkba3qKYc href=#>Cole Ragans</a>, whom they acquired from the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=120 href=#>Rangers</a> in a shrewd in-season trade for <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WSyINUzxdzqE9hVe href=#>Aroldis Chapman</a>, became their best starting pitcher, as he posted a 2.64 ERA in the second half. However, the Royals lost 106 games and do not have a strong farm system nor much to trade on their major-league roster, so it will take time for them to turn things around.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The A’s are in the midst of a complete rebuild and they are many years away from contending. However, although they finished a major-league-worst 50-112, they did get strong contributions from rookie first baseman <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0qUsdEqoTg3zZOnU href=#>Ryan Noda</a> and second baseman <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2SZT6http8epBdqF href=#>Zack Gelof</a>. Another rookie, center fielder <a class=ath_autolink data-id=99yhrYucwL9igO2F href=#>Esteury Ruiz</a>, led the AL in stolen bases but was erratic defensively. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=HPtPty2h6h1OFs7K href=#>JP Sears</a> (4.54 ERA in 172 1/3 innings) was their best starting pitcher and rookie <a class=ath_autolink data-id=V61jHMVPgJkMhSRc href=#>Mason Miller</a> showed impressive stuff. The A’s are expected to move to Las Vegas eventually but it’s unlikely they’ll build this roster into a contender by the time they open their new stadium. Like the Royals, this won’t be a quick fix but hopefully 2023 is rock bottom.</p><p>(Top image photos: Fernando Tatis Jr.: Orlando Ramirez / USA Today; Elly De La Cruz: Ronald Martinez / Getty Images; Triston Casas: Lachlan Cunningham / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3JqcGloanxzfJFsZmpoX2WGcLnLm2SmoaOosqV5z6WYsqeWm8BuvM6wnKtlopa7rLXNoKpmamBngXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toni-fowler-before-plastic-surgery.html><span>←</span><span>Toni Fowler Before Plastic Surgery, No Surgery Photo, Before and After Surgery, Age</span></a>
