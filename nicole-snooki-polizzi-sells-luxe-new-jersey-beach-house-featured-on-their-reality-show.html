Prior to this, the couple lived in the basement of Jionni’s mother’s home. It certainly was an upgrade for the couple who resided with Jionni’s family with their two children Lorenzo and Giovanna.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“That’s what made us fall in love with it,” <a href=#>Nicole said to The Post</a>. “Jionni was all about the construction and moving rooms around, making them smaller and bigger. Then once it was all done, I came in and designed everything. It’s really fun; it’s a hobby of ours.”</p><p>Nicole has become an integral part of the neighborhood business community as well. Her original brick-and-mortar store, <a href=#>The Snooki Shop</a>, originally opened in Madison, New Jersey, in 2018. It then moved to a larger location in 2021. She also opened up a second storefront in Beacon, New York, in late 2020. The business carries clothing, accessories, jewelry, and other items that Nicole hand-picks for her customers.</p><p>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation airs on Thursdays at 8/7c on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ56esLC4xGaqp6efoLZuvM6loLOymWLAprjLrGSlraiaeq%2Bx1mahnqqjmsZursSamqFlmKTCtLGMn5yarKWnsqV5zqdkraCVnr9uvsSao6KsqWLAqbvWaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./caitlyn-smith-steps-outside-her-comfort-zone-on-tour-and-with-upcoming-record-exclusive.html><span>←</span><span>Caitlyn Smith Steps Outside Her Comfort Zone On Tour And With Upcoming Record (Exclusive)</span></a>
