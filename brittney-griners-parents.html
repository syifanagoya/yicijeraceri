Little is publicly known about them, but it is clear that their selfless support throughout such a tough period has made all the difference for their daughter during this trying time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Brittney Griner’s parents?</h2><p>Brittney Griner is a 32-year-old WNBA star who started her career in 2013 with the Pheonix Mercury. She is the daughter of Raymond and Sandra. Her father, Raymond, is a military man who has been in the Vietnam war for two years.&nbsp;</p><p>After leaving the war, he went to Harris County, Texas, where he was appointed as the deputy. For 30 years, he worked in the sheriff’s department and later retired.&nbsp;</p><p>According to sources, there is not much information related to Brittney’s mother, Sandra, but it was confirmed that she was a housewife.&nbsp;</p><p>Brittney keeps her parents away from the spotlight, but it was found that she shared some pictures on social media where she was with her mom.</p><p>Her first childhood picture with her mother is also on her Instagram account.&nbsp;</p><p>In September 2015, she shared a snap and captioned it, <strong>“Me and the Family! Good old days! I’m purple in front of mom! Three of my aunts and cousin in pink and my sis with the ugly face, lol love you, sis.”</strong></p><p>In January 2021, the WNBA star shared a photo on her Instagram account where she appeared older. It was reported that the picture was from her family reunion. She captioned her mother and wife in the photo, “<strong>#WCW</strong>” or “<strong>Woman Crush Wednesday</strong>.”</p><p>Brittney said that her wife was #WCW. Brittney’s family shared a statement of the time when their daughter was arrested in a Russian penal colony. They said that her arrest was <strong>“gut-wrenching.”</strong></p><p>Brittney’s parents have always been by her side. During her difficult days, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were pleaded by Brittney’s sister,</p><p>ShKera Griner. She requested to bring justice for her sister and explained how she was arrested.&nbsp;</p><p>In June 2022, ShKera said that she hadn’t seen or met her sister, Brittney, for 100 days. She added that it is difficult for her parents, Brittney’s wife, and her sisters. She said, “<strong>I don’t wish this on anyone.</strong>“</p><p>After Brittney was allowed to relocate after a prison swap agreement, her family was relieved. More updates will be shared after the family reunites.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCu0aKrraaVrnqovsinnKurXaWus7HNrapo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./review-street-fighter-6-is-dragged-down-by-its-truly-terrible-single-player-mode.html><span>←</span><span>Review: Street Fighter 6 is dragged down by its truly terrible single-player mode</span></a>
