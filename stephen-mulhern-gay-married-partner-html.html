He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was</a>&nbsp;in a relationship with EastEnders actress Emily Barton circa 2009.</p><p>The pair started dating shortly after meeting one another in the Snow White pantomime at the Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury in 2008. The duo kept their relationship fairly private, sharing no pictures on social media and making no public appearances.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But their finely hidden love story came to what&nbsp;Mulhern called a "natural end" in 2011.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After breaking up with Barton, the&nbsp;Britain's Got Talent&nbsp;presenter got into another relationship. In an interview with Celebs Now in 2018, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;he was last on a date your years ago. Ergo, he was dating in 2014, after his split with Barton.</p><p>The Stratford native, however, didn't reveal the identity of the partner he last dated.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><u><strong>Find Out:</strong></u>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>"A Quiet Place" Star Noah Jupe's Close-Knit Family Insight With Famous Parents</a></p><h2>Privacy Around Relationship Fuels Gay Rumors</h2><p>Mulhern's personal life is fairly ambiguous. His social media like Instagram and Twitter are void of any hints of his dating life, and he mentions nothing about his relationship in neither his posts nor his interviews.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>One reason for his actions could be because he is focusing on his career&nbsp;after having multiple heartbreaks. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confessed</a>&nbsp;to having his heart broken numerous times in an interview with DailyMail back in 2013. He maintained he preferred to focus on his work and loved to enjoy alone&nbsp;when in leisure.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I keep myself to myself out of work. Mostly I just like to chill out and be on my own.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>While it is not sure if the heartbreaks are the reason why Mulhern is not dating anyone, the absence of a wife figure in his life has aroused speculations about his sexuality. But Mulhern has been tight-lipped regarding such rumors and married status as well.</p><p><u><strong>Explore:</strong></u>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Who Is Capital Fm Star Roman Kemp Dating Now After Breakup With Long-Distance Girlfriend?</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Stephen Mulhern’s&nbsp;Family</h2><p>Born in a family of market traders on 4 April 1977, Stephen Daniel Mulhern has&nbsp;two older brothers and a younger sister. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>His father taught him magic tricks every night before bedtime.
