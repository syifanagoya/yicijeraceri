He also directed the graphic novel adaptation "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" and the documentary "The Sparks Brothers," and co-wrote the screenplays to "The Adventures of Tintin" and "Ant-Man." Earlier in his career, Wright worked in television, creating the British series "Asylum" and directing the sitcom "Spaced."</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Edgar Wright was born on April 18, 1974 in Poole, Dorset, England and grew up in Wells, Somerset.

For his higher education, he went to the Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design, from which he obtained a National Diploma in audiovisual design in 1994.</p><h2 id=film-career><strong>Film Career</strong></h2><p>After making a number of short films in his youth, Wright made his feature film debut in 1995 with the low-budget Western spoof "A Fistful of Fingers." He transitioned to television in the years after that, and finally returned to film in 2004 with the zombie comedy "Shaun of the Dead," starring his frequent collaborators Simon Pegg and <a href=# title="Nick Frost Net Worth">Nick Frost</a>. The film was a major critical and commercial hit, spawning a loose trilogy of genre comedies that would come to be known as the "Three Flavors Cornetto" trilogy due to a running joke about Cornetto ice cream. The second film in the trilogy was the action cop comedy "Hot Fuzz," released in 2007; the third and final installment was the 2013 science-fiction comedy "The World's End." Wright co-wrote the screenplays to all three films with <a href=#>Simon Pegg</a>.</p><p>Between the second and third films of the "Three Flavors Cornetto" trilogy, Wright directed and co-wrote the romantic action comedy "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," based on the graphic novel series and starring <a href=#>Michael Cera</a> as the titular character. Released in 2010, the film had disappointing box-office returns, but was a significant hit with critics. The following year saw the release of another film based on a comic, "The Adventures of Tintin." Wright co-wrote the film, which was directed by <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a>, with Joe Cornish and <a href=# title="Steven Moffat Net Worth">Steven Moffat</a>. Later, in 2015, he co-wrote the Marvel superhero film "Ant-Man." Wright's next film as writer and director was the 2017 action film "Baby Driver," starring <a href=#>Ansel Elgort</a>.

Meanwhile, Wright created his first show, "Asylum"; he also directed the series, which first introduced him to Simon Pegg. In the late 90s, Wright worked as a director on such British comedy shows as "<a href=# title="Alexei Sayle Net Worth">Alexei Sayle</a>'s Merry-Go-Round," "Is it <a href=# title="Bill Bailey Net Worth">Bill Bailey</a>?," "Sir Bernard's Stately Homes," and "Murder Most Horrid."</p><p>Wright's biggest television show was "Spaced," a sitcom created and written by its stars Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson. He directed all 14 episodes of the series from 1999 to 2001, and had uncredited appearances in three of the episodes. Wright lent "Spaced" an unorthodox look for a sitcom, using dramatic camera movements and angles more familiar to the horror and science-fiction genres. After the end of that show, Wright stepped in front of the camera to play Eddie Yorque in the parody series "Look Around You," which ran from 2002 to 2005. He returned to acting in 2017 in the role of a commentator in the television mockumentary film "Tour de Pharmacy."</p><h2 id=music-videos><strong>Music Videos</strong></h2><p>Wright has also directed various music videos over the years.
