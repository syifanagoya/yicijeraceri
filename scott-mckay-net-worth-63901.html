He was re-elected in 1990, but lost to Ivon Le Duc in 1994 as Pierre Bourque became mayor.</p><span>1987</span><p>McKay was born to a francophone mother and an Irish-anglophone father in the town of Montr√©al-Est. He has completed a M.Sc. in Environmental sciences at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al and is currently working in the field of water treatment.

The party ran candidates in 108 out of Quebec's 125 districts in 2007. None of them was elected. McKay himself finished fourth in the district of Bourget with 2,632 ballots and about 8.09% of the vote. The winner was Diane Lemieux of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois.</p><span>2008</span><p>On December 8, 2008, he was elected as an MNA for the PQ in the riding of L'Assomption.
