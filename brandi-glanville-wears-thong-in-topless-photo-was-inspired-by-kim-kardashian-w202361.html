I am empowered by showing the world my flaws and not being afraid of what anyone is going to say about me. And I hope that through this platform I have been given, I can encourage the same empowerment for girls and women all over the world," <a href=#>Kardashian wrote on her blog.</a></p><span class=caption></span><p>"It's 2016. The body-shaming and slut-shaming—it's like, enough is enough. I will not live my life dictated by the issues you have with my sexuality. You be you and let me be me," she added. "I am a mother. I am a wife, a sister, a daughter, an entrepreneur and I am allowed to be sexy."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGabqpGjsap5xqWYp66ZobmmedaemKurXam1sLrGZqCnZaSkva2x0qxkqaCfqbxuw8CsZKKmo6W2s7HDZpmyZZueum63wKubmquYnq6vedZrZ2trZmZ8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-crump-children-did-steve-crump-have-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Crump Children: Did Steve Crump Have Kids?</span></a>
