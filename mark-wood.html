With the win over New Zealand, England had qualified for the semi-final stage of the tournament for the first time since 1992. This was also<br>the first time since 1983 that England had beaten New Zealand in the tournament.</li><li>In the final of the tournament, also against New Zealand, he was run out on the last ball of the match to leave the scores tied. This meant that the match had to be decided via a tie-breaking ‘super over’ which, in bizarre circumstances, also ended up getting tied. England was then declared the victor based on a highly controversial ‘boundary countback’ rule.</li><li>Mark was one of the stars of England’s title-winning campaign as he was the joint 5th-highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 18 scalps to his name.</li><li>He had sustained a side injury during that final match which had ruled him out of the first three test matches of the 2019 Ashes series which had started within a month of that match.</li><p>Featured Image by Mark Wood / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqaYq6NdrLywsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-susan-sarandons-daughter-eva-amurri-engaged-to-about-chef-ian-hock-and-their-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Susan Sarandons daughter Eva Amurri engaged to?
