At the time, she intended for the site to give her fans a window into her personal life. Per <a href=#>Woman & Home</a>, The Tig featured a variety of lifestyle features, touching on everything from fashion and health, to food, travel, and Meghan's career. That's not to say all the content she posted was fluff — because it wasn't. Per <a href=#>Elle UK</a>, the mother-of-two shared her own experience with segregation in a 2015 post, recounting the time her family was made to eat chicken in the parking lot after making a roadtrip pit stop at Kentucky Fried Chicken. "It makes me think of the countless black jokes people have shared in front of me, not realizing I am mixed, unaware that I am the ethnically ambiguous fly on the wall," Meghan wrote at the time, according to Elle UK.</p><p dir=ltr>It's clear that The Tig was more than just a casual side project, and as such, the Duchess of Sussex was loath to part ways with the site following her engagement to Prince Harry. "After close to three beautiful years on this adventure with you, it's time to say goodbye to The Tig. What began as a passion project (my little engine that could) evolved into an amazing community of inspiration, support, fun, and frivolity," Meghan wrote in a goodbye post, according to Elle UK.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcHFnZ4N1e9ahmK1lmJa9sbHNnptmrJ9iuqazx5qlZqWRp7itsdJmmaWnl2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1000-lb-sisters-amy-and-tammy-now.html><span>←</span><span>Where Are '1000-LB Sisters' Stars Amy and Tammy Now?
