<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>These Six 2019 Real Estate Deals All Topped $100 Million</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There was a small group of absolutely enormous real estate sales in 2019 that topped $100 million. From a penthouse in Manhattan, to mansions in Palm Beach and Los Angeles, these mega deals made the news. In Palm Beach, in particular, a number of very high-priced deals sparked debate over the number of wealthy New Yorkers moving to Florida as a result of the 2017 change in federal tax law. A number of $100 million-plus deals in Los Angeles put emphasis on the ultra-high-end real estate on the West Coast.</p><p>It almost goes without saying at this point that the highest price paid for a home in 2019 was hedge fund manager Ken Griffin's $238 million purchase of a penthouse on Manhattan's billionaire's row. Griffin has been on a real estate buying spree for a number of years now. In fact, Griffin had two properties on the list of the 10 most expensive this year. He also paid $99.1 million for a Palm Beach property, the eighth highest-priced real estate deal of the year.</p><p>Prior to 2019, the most $100 million-plus deals in one year was three in both 2014 and 2016. In 2019 there were six $100 million-plus deals. Three of the deals were in Los Angeles, two in Palm Beach, and one in New York City.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-291319 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1087945056.jpg alt width=900 height=587 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-291319 class=wp-caption-text>220 Central Park South (TIMOTHY A.

A Charles Gwathmey House in Malibu</strong></p><p>Price: $100 million</p><p>In August, NBCUniversal vice chairman <a href=# title="Ron Meyer Net Worth">Ron Meyer</a> sold his Malibu estate for $100 million to WhatsApp founded <a href=# title="Jan Koum Net Worth">Jan Koum</a>. Earlier in the year, the property was on the market for $125 million. The 14,000-square-foot house sits on three oceanfront acres. The house has six bedrooms, a two story library, a home theatre and gym. The house was designed for Meyer in the late 1990s by architect Charles Gwathmey.</p><p><strong>#5. La Follia, Palm Beach</strong></p><p>Price: $110.25 million</p><p>This luxurious Palm Beach estate sold over the summer for $110.25 million after hitting the market for $135 million in October 2018.

It set a price record for Florida. Schonfeld isn't planning to make La Reverie his primary home. A 2017 tax law imposed a $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions in New York, which sent some wealthy people fleeing higher tax states for places like Palm Beach. The 70,000-square-foot property has 11 bedrooms and 22 bathrooms, a bowling alley, candy parlor, a tennis court, pool, and an ice cream stand.</p><p><strong>#3.

Not long after he signed the deal, the New York legislature expanded the "mansion tax," which is designed to target buyers of properties priced at $2 million or more. The brand new building's other residents include <a href=# title="Sting Net Worth">Sting</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfqbWmv8RmqqKwXWd9coWMq5yapF2awLWt055knZ2RocBurculZK2noKWypXmQaWdmpZmhuaq7zWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-ufo-her-voice-reveal-has-fans-guessing-a-disney-star.html><span>←</span><span>Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy's final scene in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League SLAMMED by f</span></a>
