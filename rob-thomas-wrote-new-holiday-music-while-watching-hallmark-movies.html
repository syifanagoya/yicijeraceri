As self-proclaimed “Hallmark movie geek” <a href=#><strong>Rob Thomas</strong></a> prepared to <a href=#>write new holiday songs</a>, he had a very jolly source of inspiration.</p><p class=p1>“I lucked out because during the summer <a href=#>Hallmark movie channel was having their ‘Christmas in July’ [marathon]</a>,” Thomas, 49, exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>on Monday, November 1, while promoting his new&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Something About Christmas Time</a>&nbsp;</i>album. “So, like, I could just leave that on the whole time, and then I only had to, like, you know, bring down <a href=#>my Christmas DVDs</a> — of which I have many — just for a little bit of June and a little bit in August.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/rob-thomas-wrote-new-holiday-music-while-watching-hallmark-movies-main.jpg><p class=p1>Not only did the “Unwell” crooner seek inspiration from <a href=#>these spirited TV programs</a>, but a reimagined version of his “A New York Christmas” song will be included in the network’s upcoming&nbsp;<i>A Royal Queens Christmas</i>, which is set for a premiere this holiday season during<a href=#> its “Countdown to Christmas” lineup</a>.</p><p class=p1>Thomas couldn’t help but gush over the announcement, telling&nbsp;<i>Us</i>, “Because <a href=#>I’m a Christmas geek</a>, I’m a Hallmark movie geek and my wife is from Queens and she is <a href=#>a Hallmark movie geek</a> … And then because of that, I’m going to be in the Thanksgiving Day Parade on the Hallmark float.”</p><p class=p1>He was also quick to divulge his favorite made-for-TV movie on the TV network.</p><p class=p1>“I think my favorite, it’s almost an asterisk one because it used to not be on Hallmark and then Hallmark bought it, but it’s a movie called&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Most Wonderful Time of the Year</a>&nbsp;</i>and it stars <a href=#><strong>Henry Winkler</strong></a>,” he said.</p><p class=p1>As such a big Hallmarkie who enjoyed their holiday programming, the Matchbox Twenty performer was enthused about the prospect of <a href=#>creating a full-length Christmas album.</a></p><p class=p1>“You know, every year it’s Christmas time, I’m sitting at the piano at some point, and I’m like, ‘Oh, I want to do a Christmas album.’ And it’s always too late because if you do a Christmas album, a lot of people don’t realize you have to do it in the summer that way <a href=#>it’s ready by Christmas time</a> and nobody’s feeling Christmas-y [then],” the “Lonely No More” singer explained of his writing process. “So the first thing I had to do was I had to kind of shut everything here in my studio, covering everything in Christmas lights, keep Christmas movies on at all times, [and] keep the Christmas vibe kind of, like, going and flowing.”</p><p class=p1>The Grammy winner further teased the songs on the record, several of which featured duets from the likes of <a href=#><strong>Brad Paisley</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Ingrid Michaelson</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“Well, it was almost, you know, once I started writing the songs and figuring out the covers, it’s almost like casting a film,” Thomas explained. “So I <a href=#>wrote this country banger</a> called ‘Santa Don’t Come Here Anymore [and] so Brad Paisley, that was a no-brainer [with] that voice and the way he plays guitar. … Ingrid Michaelson is a Christmas geek, I mean,<a href=#> she loves Christmas</a> [and] had just put out a Christmas record of her own last year. [She] and I bonded over that love of Christmas.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Rob Thomas’&nbsp;<i>Something About Christmas Time&nbsp;</i>album is available now and he will perform tracks from the album during an exclusive <a href=#>livestream concert</a> on StageIt, presented by <a href=#>VNUE,</a> on Monday, November 8, at 8 p.m. ET.
