Earlier this month, the late-night host drudged up old rumors about The Marchioness of Cholmondeley and Prince William having an affair while discussing the speculation surrounding <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kate Middleton</a>'s whereabouts during his opening monologue.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The kingdom has been all aflutter by the seeming disappearance of Kate Middleton. Well, now internet sleuths are guessing that Kate’s absence may be related to her husband and the future king of England, William, having an affair,” Colbert said, before calling Hanbury out by name. “So I think we all know who the alleged other woman is. Say it with me: the Marchioness of Cholmondeley."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hanbury, who has been married since 2009 and is a mother to three children, previously denied the allegations in a statement via her legal team to Business Insider, telling the outlet that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>“the rumors are completely false.”</a> And recently, she took things a step further and sent a written notice to Colbert and CBS over his comments.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The rumor appears to have entered into the mainstream media recently as a result of another joke made about it on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” Hanbury’s lawyers said in a statement, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a>. “We have written on our client’s behalf to CBS and various other reputable media organizations to confirm that the allegation is false.”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rumors of an affair between Hanbury and the Prince of Wales began back in 2019 after there was a reported falling out between the noblewoman and Kate Middleton — however, those claims have gone unfounded.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hanbury's legal action against Colbert reportedly was sent out prior to Middleton revealing her cancer diagnosis on Friday (March 22). In <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>an emotional video</a>, the princess asked the public for “time, space, and privacy” as she undergoes her preventative chemotherapy treatment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This of course came as a huge shock and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family," she explained of her diagnosis, adding: "As you can imagine this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment, but most importantly it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte, and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them and to reassure them that I’m going to be OK."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-more-in-celeb-news></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570aiqnmWYlrujwdGyZKyslaW1prqMnKalmpWnwW64xKCYpWWepMGqr8Rmp6uhnpiybsPIpaOimZ1irqeywKKpZqKfoLJuhJVqcG9rZQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alejandro-speitzer-age-wiki-biography-net-worth-height-in-feet-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Alejandro Speitzer Age, Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Height in Feet, Parents</span></a>
