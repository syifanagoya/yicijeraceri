The Jeep was heading north and was about to navigate a sharp right turn, while, at the same moment, a big semi-truck was coming from the opposite direction towards the same curve.</p><p><strong>Unfortunately, the Jeep was going too fast and crossed into the lane where the semi-truck was driving, leading to a devastating head-on collision between the two vehicles. The impact was so severe that the Jeep ended up overturned on the road. It’s really sad to say that the people in the Jeep, the driver named David Faulx, aged 65 from Cabot, and a 12-year-old boy named Zane Rupert from Saxonburg, lost their lives at the scene.</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>On a slightly brighter note, the driver of the semi-truck suffered only minor injuries.
